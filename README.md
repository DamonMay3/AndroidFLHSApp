AndroidFLHSApp
==============

This is the source code for the unpackaged Android App.
The res directory (resources) contains the XML and really all other media for the APK besides the java class files.
Values, Layouts, and Menus are all stored there and written in XML.
The res--dpi folders are for storing all the drawables (PNG's, JPG's, GIF's). These are all the pictures!
The java folder stores all the class files. These are the actual programs in the app. 
The main package is com.flhs. This package contains another package, com.flhs.utils. This package has all the utility classes
that were were made for the classes in com.flhs.
The com.flhs classes are the Activities. Each activity is a seperate section of the app. To learn about activities.
